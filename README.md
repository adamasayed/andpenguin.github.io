## Projects
Here are the overviews of some of the projects I have made

### AAFSG

AAFSG is an online seed finder that looks for good seeds for All Advancements Speedruns using code to predict Java random calls. The filter looks through millions of seeds to see how the world will generate, and predicts one that will be useful. You can find the filter's website at [aafsg.com](https://aafsg.com)

The repository that powers the project can be found [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/AAFSG)

### MC Resetting Server

Collaborations on a project to create code for a web server to create a server that can reset using in game /stop. This allows the player to reset much faster than having to go to the game files, stop the game, delete the world files, and relaunch. If interested in speedrunning using AWS or GCP servers, this is a good addition.

The project can be found [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/MCSRS)
