## MC Resetting Server

Collaborations on a project to create code for a web server to create a server that can reset using in game /stop. This allows the player to reset much faster than having to go to the game files, stop the game, delete the world files, and relaunch. If interested in speedrunning using AWS or GCP servers, this is a good addition.

The project can be found [here](https://github.com/andpenguin/MCSRS)
